## MacGrouper

This is a test library for learning about how to successfully grouped/sectioned
content in an Android RecyclerView. Concepts in this project are borrowed
heavily from [Groupie](https://github.com/lisawray/groupie). For all intents and purposes,
Groupie is the better library and should be used instead. This library spawned from
an issue [I reported](https://github.com/lisawray/groupie/issues/145), that I was later able
to resolve with a change to my layout.

If you are still interested in working with this library a sample project exists in `/app`.
